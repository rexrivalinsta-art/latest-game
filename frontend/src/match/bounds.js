/**
 * The bounded-match contract, client side.
 *
 * Every VANGUARD match is a bounded free-for-all: first to `SCORE_LIMIT` kills
 * wins outright, and `MATCH_MS` is the time cap — when it expires the leader
 * wins on time. The defaults are sized for a quick match during a work break:
 * fifteen kills is a few minutes of honest shooting in a small room, and five
 * minutes ends it even when everybody is hiding.
 *
 * Who enforces it depends on who owns the score:
 *
 *   ROOM MATCH   the relay counts the kills, so the relay ends the match —
 *                SCORE_LIMIT / MATCH_MS in server/index.mjs (mirrored in
 *                worker/room.js) are the authoritative copy of these numbers,
 *                and `match_end` arrives on the wire. These constants then only
 *                paint the HUD until the relay's own figures land.
 *   BOTS MATCH   nothing but this client can see it, so this module scores it:
 *                the player against the garrison as one opponent. Your kills
 *                against their kills (= your deaths), same limit both ways, so
 *                a bots match can be lost exactly as honestly as it is won.
 *
 * Pure and clock-free — every method takes `now` (ms, any monotonic clock) —
 * so the whole contract is checkable in Node: see ./bounds.selftest.mjs.
