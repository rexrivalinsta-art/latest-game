/**
 * MATCH — the pre-match state machine and the Match Start view.
 *
 * The game used to be live on the first frame: the AI garrison was spawned
 * during boot and the player had control the moment pointer lock was granted.
 * Now every normal load opens on a menu and the match starts when somebody asks
 * for it, one of two ways:
 *
 *   BOTS         pick a garrison size, press play, deploy immediately.
 *   MULTIPLAYER  share the room link; once a second player is in the room both
 *                press READY, the relay fires one start signal (see
 *                `maybeStart()` in server/index.mjs) and both clients run the
 *                same countdown. No bots in this mode — it is players only.
 *
 * The two are not exclusive, and that is the point: a bots match started while
 * you are alone in a room is a WARM-UP. The relay keeps it private and does not
 * let it make the room live, so the friends arriving on your link still get the
 * ready flow — and when the start signal fires this system pulls you out of the
 * bots and into the match with them (`_onCountdown`). Nobody has to leave
 * anything first.
 *
 * The lobby collapses both into ONE primary button whose meaning follows the
 * room (see the header of ./ui.js); this system resolves a click on it against
 * the live lobby state in `_primary()`.
 *
 * WHAT IT OWNS
 *   • `state`: 'setup' -> 'countdown' -> 'live', and the gating that goes with
 *     it — input, player control, HUD visibility, pointer lock.
 *   • WHICH MAP is loaded. `world` owns the map list and the rebuild; this
 *     system owns the moment it is allowed to happen — on the lobby and
 *     nowhere else — and, in a room, defers the choice to the relay so
 *     everybody switches together (see `_chooseMap` / `_applyMap`).
 *   • WHERE the player deploys — a spawn scored by `world.spawns` rather than
 *     the menu backdrop everyone was standing on — and, when there is no `net`
 *     to own it, the respawn cycle after a bot kills you.
 *   • WHEN the garrison spawns. `config.deferGarrison` (set in src/boot.js) tells
 *     `ai` not to populate during boot; this system calls `ai.populate()` with
 *     the chosen size at the moment the match starts, so a players-only match
 *     really has no bots in it.
 *   • The lobby sounds: join, ready, countdown ticks, deployment horn.
 *   • Breaking room news while the lobby is up. `net`'s overlay — and with it
 *     its join/leave card — is hidden behind this screen, so `_onPresence`
 *     re-raises the same card here and flashes the roster row that changed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN
 *   The wire. `net` carries the lobby and reports it as `net:lobby`,
 *   `net:countdown`, `net:join` and `net:leave`; this system reads those events
 *   and calls `net.setReady()` / `net.deploy()`. With `?mp=0` there is no `net`
 *   at all and only the bots path is offered.
 *
 * WHEN A MATCH ENDS. Every match is a bounded free-for-all — first to the
 *   kill target, or the leader at full time (see ./bounds.js). The relay
 *   referees a room match, because the relay owns the score; this system
 *   referees a bots match, because nobody else can see it. Either way the end
 *   lands here, in the CEREMONY: the winner's name in their livery, the final
 *   standings, and a timed walk back to the lobby — which is where the
 *   existing rematch flow was already waiting.
 *
 * EVENTS EMITTED
 *   match:start { bots, squads, perSquad, mode }   the match is live
 *   match:countdown { seconds }                    a countdown tick landed
 *   match:end { reason }                           back out to the lobby
 *                                                  ('complete' = it was won)
